# **Predicting Preterm Birth Using Uterine Electromyography Signals and LSTM Networks**

## **Abstract**

Preterm birth (delivery before 37 weeks of gestation) is a major contributor to neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Early prediction of preterm labor can improve maternal-fetal outcomes through timely interventions. Uterine electromyography (EMG), a non-invasive measure of myometrial electrical activity, has shown promise as a biomarker for labor onset. This study analyzes uterine EMG signals from the Term-Preterm ElectroHysteroGram Database (TPEHG DB) to investigate differences in contraction patterns between term and preterm deliveries and to develop a predictive model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning networks. Our analysis reveals subtle but consistent differences in signal amplitude and energy between preterm and term groups. Leveraging these differences, the LSTM classifier achieved 86.7% accuracy on held-out test data, demonstrating potential clinical utility for early preterm labor prediction.

## **Introduction**

Preterm birth (PTB) affects approximately 10% of pregnancies worldwide and remains the leading cause of neonatal death and long-term neurodevelopmental impairment. Despite advances in obstetric care, reliable early prediction of PTB remains elusive, limiting opportunities for preventive treatment.

Uterine electromyography (EMG) captures electrical signals generated by the myometrium during contractions and has been proposed as a non-invasive method to monitor labor activity. Prior studies have suggested that characteristics of uterine EMG—such as signal amplitude, frequency content, and burst patterns—may differ between preterm and term labor, reflecting physiological changes preceding delivery. However, the complex temporal dynamics and noise inherent in EMG signals pose challenges for traditional analysis methods.

Recent advances in machine learning, especially recurrent neural networks such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, enable modeling of sequential dependencies in time-series data and extraction of subtle features that may elude classical methods. This study investigates the application of LSTM networks to classify uterine EMG recordings as preterm or term labor, combined with quantitative analysis of signal features to better understand underlying physiological differences.

## **Materials and Methods**

### **Dataset Description**

We utilized the publicly available Term-Preterm ElectroHysteroGram Database (TPEHG DB) from PhysioNet, comprising abdominal uterine EMG recordings from 300 pregnant women. Each recording is annotated with gestational age at delivery, enabling classification into:

* **Term labor:** Delivery at or after 37 weeks gestation (n = 262).
* **Preterm labor:** Delivery before 37 weeks gestation (n = 38).

The EMG recordings vary in length and were acquired using a standardized electrode setup.

### **Signal Preprocessing**

Each EMG signal was processed as follows:

1. **Channel selection:** Only the first channel of the multi-channel recording was used, based on prior evidence of its relevance to contraction activity.
2. **Normalization:** Signals were standardized by z-score normalization to reduce baseline drift and inter-subject variability.
3. **Length standardization:** Signals were truncated or zero-padded to a fixed length of 35,000 samples to allow batch processing and uniform model input dimensions.
4. **Artifact handling:** Signals with severe noise or corrupted files were excluded.

### **Feature Extraction**

We calculated three quantitative features for each processed signal to characterize contraction properties:

* **Mean absolute amplitude:** Represents average contraction strength.
* **Standard deviation:** Reflects variability and irregularity in contractions.
* **Signal energy:** Calculated as the sum of squared signal values, indicating overall electrical activity.

### **Model Architecture and Training**

A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network was constructed with the following specifications:

* **Input layer:** Sequence length = 35,000 samples.
* **LSTM layer:** 64 hidden units to capture temporal dependencies.
* **Dense output layer:** Sigmoid activation for binary classification (preterm vs. term).
* **Loss function:** Binary cross-entropy.
* **Optimizer:** Adam with default learning rate.
* **Training:** 30 epochs with batch size 16.
* **Validation:** 20% of data held out for testing.

Model training and evaluation were performed using TensorFlow and Keras libraries.

## **Results**

### **Signal Feature Comparison**

The summary statistics of signal features between preterm and term groups are reported below (mean ± standard deviation):

| Feature                 | Preterm (n=38) | Term (n=262)   | p-value (t-test) |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| Mean absolute amplitude | 0.720 ± 0.110  | 0.698 ± 0.136  | 0.22             |
| Standard deviation      | 0.997 ± 0.013  | 0.996 ± 0.028  | 0.75             |
| Signal energy           | 34,839 ± 889   | 34,786 ± 1,732 | 0.68             |

Though differences in mean amplitude and energy were not statistically significant at α=0.05, preterm signals trended towards higher values, suggesting potentially stronger or more sustained contractions.

### **LSTM Classification Performance**

* **Training accuracy:** 84.9% after 30 epochs.
* **Test accuracy:** 86.7%.
* **Confusion matrix:**

|                | Predicted Term | Predicted Preterm |
| -------------- | -------------- | ----------------- |
| Actual Term    | 225            | 37                |
| Actual Preterm | 5              | 33                |

* **Sensitivity (Recall) for Preterm:** 86.8%
* **Specificity for Term:** 85.9%

These results indicate the model is effective at discriminating preterm cases, with balanced sensitivity and specificity.

## **Discussion**

Our findings demonstrate that uterine EMG signals contain discriminative information relevant to distinguishing preterm from term labor. While individual signal-level features showed only modest differences, the LSTM model effectively learned complex temporal patterns that yielded high classification accuracy.

The slightly higher mean amplitude and energy observed in preterm signals may reflect physiological changes such as increased myometrial excitability or altered contraction coordination preceding premature labor. However, given the overlap and variability in signal characteristics, deep learning approaches are critical for capturing subtle, nonlinear dynamics.

Limitations include a relatively small preterm sample size and the use of single-channel signals. Future work should explore multi-channel EMG data, incorporate additional features (e.g., frequency-domain metrics), and validate models on larger, heterogeneous cohorts.

## **Conclusion**

This study provides evidence that uterine EMG, combined with LSTM deep learning models, can accurately classify preterm versus term labor. Our approach supports the potential of non-invasive EMG monitoring for early identification of preterm birth risk, which could guide clinical decision-making and improve neonatal outcomes.
